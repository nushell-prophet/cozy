description: Turn the current chat into a gi canvas, or open an existing one. Use when the user says "gi canvas", "start a canvas", "переведи в канвас", "продолжим в канвасе", "open the canvas", or asks to move this conversation into a canvas document.

The user wants a canvas session but is inside a chat session, where typing nushell into Bash is awkward.
Run the module command for them and hand back one line to paste into a terminal.

A canvas session cannot be started from within a session: the gi plugin (the Canvas style and the gi skills), the Stop hook, the canvas path in the new session's own instructions, and `$env.GI_CANVAS` for the hook all arrive with `claude` at launch.
So this skill always ends the same way — the user runs one command themselves, in their terminal, and that new session is the canvas one.

## How to call the module

`claude-nu` is a nushell module command, not a program on PATH: it is loaded in the user's interactive REPL, and a one-shot `nu -c` does not load it.
So every command **you** run has to import it first:

```nushell
nu -c 'use ~/repos/claude-nu/claude-nu/; claude-nu gi'
```

That path is the common one, not a guarantee.
When it is missing, don't guess a second one — read where the REPL itself imports from: `grep -h claude-nu ~/.config/nushell/autoload/*.nu`.
The `use` line there names the real directory on this machine.

The commands **the user** runs go into their REPL, where the module is already loaded — hand those over bare: `claude-nu gi open <doc>`.

## Which case

First check you are not already there.
`gi` on its own reports which plugin carries the protocol and whether the asking session is bound to a canvas; a non-null `canvas` means this **is** a canvas session — say so and stop, there is nothing to launch.
Doing this first matters because the alternative is importing a session that is already a canvas into a second file, which splits one conversation across two documents.
`ls gi/*.md` lists the repo's existing canvases.

Then read `$ARGUMENTS` and the conversation:

- **No canvas yet, and this chat is worth keeping** (the usual case) → import this session.
- **No canvas yet, nothing here worth keeping** → a blank canvas.
- **A canvas path is given or exists in `gi/`** → open it.

A canvas keeps one session for life, and `gi open` handles both halves of that: a canvas with no `session:` in its frontmatter gets one minted and written in, one that has it is resumed.
You do not have to tell them apart.

## Import this session

```nushell
nu -c 'use ~/repos/claude-nu/claude-nu/; claude-nu gi import'                     # → gi/session-<id>.md
nu -c 'use ~/repos/claude-nu/claude-nu/; claude-nu gi import --tools'             # ...keeping tool calls, each input rendered whole
nu -c 'use ~/repos/claude-nu/claude-nu/; claude-nu gi import --to notes/x.md'     # ...at a chosen path
```

Named with no session, `gi import` takes the one it runs inside — which is this one, since you are running it.
The first positional names another session, and only the user needs that (they get a completer for it in the REPL).

It refuses to overwrite an existing doc — that is deliberate, do not delete the old one to get past it; name another path instead.

Nothing has to be in the repo beforehand: the style and the skills ride the launch as a plugin, so there is no seeding step and nothing the import can find missing.

Then tell the user, in one line: exit this session and run `claude-nu gi open <doc>`.
The import wrote this session's id into the canvas, so that reopens **this same session** (same id, full context) with the canvas bound, and the missing tail — the turns after the import, which the session log cannot contain yet — is still in context and can be appended there.

## Blank canvas, or an existing one

`gi open` launches Claude Code itself, so the user runs it — not you.
Hand over one of these, as is:

```nushell
claude-nu gi open                 # new timestamped canvas, then launch
claude-nu gi open gi/plan.md      # a named one; created if new, resumed if it holds a session
claude-nu gi open <doc> --no-hook # style only, no Stop-hook floor
```

## What to report

One line with the exact command to run.
No explanation of the protocol, no summary of what the canvas is; the style file does that once the session starts.
