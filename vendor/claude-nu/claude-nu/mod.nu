# claude-nu - Nushell utilities for Claude Code
#
# Public commands (see README.md for details):
#   projects        # List Claude Code projects, most recent first
#   sessions        # Parse sessions into a structured table
#   messages        # Extract user messages from a session
#   export-session  # Render a session's dialogue to markdown; --to writes it to files
#   commits         # Per-commit Claude-authorship table; --by-month for the monthly share
#   code-authorship # Claude's share of the lines living in the tree now (git blame)
#   gi              # gi protocol: status on its own; gi enable seeds a repo, gi open launches a session bound to a canvas
#
# Usage:
#   use claude-nu
#   claude-nu messages 'regex'                     # search this project's messages
#   claude-nu sessions --all-projects | claude-nu messages 'regex'

# Why no umbrella `main` (the old `claude-nu -f 'regex'`): search was written
# three ways that differed only in scope, and scope was the one thing the syntax
# didn't show. Now it is always to the left of the pipe — `messages 'x'` for this
# project, `sessions --all-projects | messages 'x'` for every project — and the
# rg pre-filter that made `-f` fast moved into `messages`, where the scope is.
export use sessions.nu [
    projects messages main export-session
]
# `gi check` is deliberately absent: it is the Stop hook's body, not a verb a
# user types, and the hook imports it straight from gi.nu (see GI_COMMAND).
export use gi.nu [ main "gi enable" "gi open" ]
export use attribution.nu [ commits code-authorship ]
