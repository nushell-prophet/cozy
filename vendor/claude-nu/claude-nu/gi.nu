# gi — the gi protocol: carried by a plugin, activated per session at launch.
#
# The gi protocol moves all "what/why" into git: the diff and the commit body
# carry the record, the chat carries almost nothing. Two commands do the work,
# and the split between them is the whole design:
#
#   gi import          writes one canvas, from a session's dialogue — the one it
#                      runs inside, or any session named on the line. The only
#                      verb that can capture the session running it, since it
#                      launches nothing: `open` cannot be reached from the
#                      session being imported.
#   gi open            launches Claude Code bound to one canvas. `--plugin-dir`
#                      hands `claude` the gi plugin — the Canvas output style
#                      and the skills that work a canvas — for that launch only;
#                      `--settings` carries the style's name and the Stop hook;
#                      `--append-system-prompt` names the canvas to the agent;
#                      and $env.GI_CANVAS names it to the hook, which runs as a
#                      child of that session. A canvas holds one session for
#                      life — a canvas with no session gets one minted and
#                      written in, one that has it is resumed. Which case it is,
#                      the file says; there is no second verb.
#                      `--new-session` is the way out when that session is gone
#                      (deleted, expired): it overwrites the recorded id.
#                      `--fork` is the other direction — keep the canvas bound
#                      as it is and open a copy of it (`plan.md` -> `plan_1.md`)
#                      on a session of its own, so a document planned in one
#                      conversation can be carried on in a fresh context while
#                      the conversation that planned it stays readable.
#
# Bare `gi` is the third name and does no work: it reports which plugin supplies
# the protocol and which canvas the asking session is bound to.
#
# Why a plugin and not files copied into each repo, which is what this replaced:
# `--plugin-dir` loads a directory for one session, reading it in place. Copying
# was copy-if-absent, so every repo was pinned to whatever the module held when
# it was first seeded, and nothing anybody reads reported the drift — repos ran
# months of canvas sessions on a style and skills the module had long since
# rewritten. Reading in place cannot go stale, writes nothing into the repo, and
# still loads only for launches gi makes, so a plain `claude` anywhere is
# untouched. It also deleted the whole seeding half of this file: gi-paths,
# gi-seed, gi-stale, the `.claude/.gitignore` block, and `gi enable` itself.
# Plugin components are namespaced by the plugin's name, so the style is
# `gi:Canvas` and the skills are `gi:git-intent` and friends — verified against
# the CLI, an unnamespaced `Canvas` resolves to nothing and the launch is
# silently style-less.
#
# Why activation lives at launch and not in .claude/settings.local.json (which
# is what this replaced): outputStyle, hooks, and env in a settings file are
# repo-wide and load into EVERY session in the repo. A canvas opened yesterday
# kept shaping unrelated sessions today, and the only cure was remembering to
# run `gi disable`. With per-launch activation there is no state to forget: a
# plain `claude` in any repo is a plain session, always.
#
# The style is proactive shaping only — it rests on prose, and the agent drifts
# back to long chat answers. The Stop hook is the structural floor under it: it
# blocks the turn when the final chat message is more than one short line, and
# blocks turns ending on main/master (gi commits are internal
# working history — they reach a public branch only squash-merged, after
# finalization). It comes with every `gi open`; `--no-hook` opens a canvas with
# the style alone.
#
# There is no `gi disable` and no migration path: gi writes to no settings file,
# so there is nothing to switch off. A repo set up by the older, repo-wide gi
# keeps working from its own settings until those keys are deleted by hand.

# and under cozy that is `~/repos/claude-nu` — the stable module path across
# machine states (vendored snapshot, sync-repos clone, dev-link symlink to the

# Why a script and not `-c 'use ...; $in | gi check'`: the hook body then lives
# in a checked file (see gi-hook.nu) rather than in a string literal nesting
